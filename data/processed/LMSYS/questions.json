Notice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)sqrt(9) = 3sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), which means that including sqrt(18) in the field doesn't actually increase the degree of the extension.\nThus, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\nFor the degree of a simple extension field Q(a, b) over Q, we want to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the degrees of the extension fields Q(a) over Q and Q(b) over Q.\nsqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational numbers, and the minimal polynomials that they are roots of are both quadratic (x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively). Thus, the extension fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are both of degree 2 over Q.\nTherefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree lcm(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 over Q. The square root of 18 does not increase the degree of the field, as explained above.\nSo, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) also has degree 4 over Q.\nAnswer key: \"B\"<end>\n\n<start>Question: NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, who is twice NAME_3's age at seven.

The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.[1] Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.\n\nKopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines,[3] where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kap\u00e9 alam\u00edd in Tagalog areas, kap\u00e9 mel\u00f4 or kap\u00e9 musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'NAME_1 coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name c\u00e0 ph\u00ea Ch\u1ed3n.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.\n\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.\n\nAlthough kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans.[7] Another epithet given to it is that it is NAME_2 of coffees.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the cost of Kopi Luwak per kilogram\n\nAnswer:\"\n",

And perhaps the soil\\u2019s most important inhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger than several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet\\u2019s dead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin breaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume and excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition sets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present depend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields there tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down grass and leaves. But in this temperate forest there are more fungi, capable of breaking down complex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food from the apple\\u2019s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction called oxidation.\\nCreate a multiple-choice question based on the transcript, where the correct answer is \\\"C) 25\\\"\\n",

Asian manufacturers such as LG and Samsung (both No \nCurrent Recommendation - NCR) have been gaining market share with cheaper products, \nand there are also capacity additions from European manufacturers. \nThus we believe pricing will come down, putting pressure on both revenue growth and, \nmore importantly, margins in the medium term - which are at --15% and can fall to single \ndigits. It is in H2'23 and FY'24 that we expect to see the first signs of such pricing pressure \naffecting NIBE's revenues. \nWe reiterate our Short recommendation, with N60% downside potential, although bring up \nour price target slightly to SEK 42 per share to account for continued strong company \nperformance and thus an increase to our FY'23 and FY'24 earnings estimates. \nGermany - Heat Pump Economics \nIn Germany, the drive away from natural gas to renewables is higher than almost anywhere \ndue to the particularly high previous usage of Russian natural gas. The German \ngovernment has banned new fossil-fuel heating installations unless they are part of a \nsystem that runs on >65% renewables, starting in January 2024. \nWe look at the payback time for a customer when installing a heat pump compared to a \nnew gas boiler in Germany to see if the economics stack up both for German households \nand the government. We have seen various payback periods mentioned, and therefore \nattempt to come up with our own estimate of the payback time for an air source heat \npump that can power heating and hot water in a typical single-family house, which is \n150sqm and uses 24,000 kWh of gas per year for heating and hot water. \n\u2022 Estimates of the average costs of an air to water heat pump vary in Germany. \nEnergieheld mention \u20ac1 8,750 for a 15",

And while staying out all hours of the night is fun, especially compared to studying for finals, the trip back home might not be. The limited number of available Safe Ride drivers and a flawed interface have left students frustrated and, at times, hopeless. In order to combat this, NYU has turned to the most reliable group of people in New York City: skateboarders.\n\n NYU has partnered with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in order to recruit skaters from different parks around the city. If skaters can be in the city\u2019s parks after dark and come out unharmed, then clearly they know how to be safe.\n\n \u201cWe are proud to represent New York\u2019s finest \u2014 looks wise,\u201d one Safe Ride skateboarder, who claims to know how to play guitar, boasted.\n\nAdding skaters, people who are used to the streets, just made sense. One safety officer even described how they \u201cadded to the cool factor of NYU Campus Safety.\u201d \n\n Once the city\u2019s parks are closed, the skaters are offered free stick-and-poke tattoos and hand-rolled cigarettes in exchange for escorting NYU students to their dorms late at night. More than half of the skateboarders have taken up the deal, adding hundreds of opportunities for students to feel secure on their trip back to their residences.\n\n These skaters are then given a harness, which connects them to a small crate that goes behind them. Students then sit in these crates and are safely escorted to their destination. Unfortunately, only one student may ride in these carts at a time.\n\nThe long wait times and faulty applications of the old Safe Ride system are only exacerbated by bad weather.

The two actions are:  {0: Push cart to the left} {1: Push cart to the right}\n\n[Note]The velocity that is reduced or increased by the applied force is not fixed and it depends on the angle the pole is pointing. The center of gravity of the pole varies the amount of energy needed to move the cart underneath it \n\n[Reward] Since the goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible, a reward of\u00a0`+1`\u00a0for every step taken, including the termination step, is allotted. The threshold for rewards is 500 for v1 and 200 for v0.\n\n[Episode End] The episode ends if any one of the following occurs:\n\n1. Termination: Pole Angle is greater than \u00b112\u00b0\n2.

Write the first chapter out of 12 chapters of a story about flowers that trap humans inside of them and what the humans experience while they are trapped inside the flowers.  Focus on showing, not telling. Focus on the senses of sound and touch and on new senses that the humans did not even know existed. The flowers have petals that can expand into cloaks when a human is nearby, trapping the human and pulling them inside the flower. The humans are drawn to the flowers because they are so beautiful. The flowers give off an intoxicating scent when the petal cloaks are expanding, causing a sense of disorientation but also mild euphoria in the humans who smell it. The trapped humans feel remorse for what they have lost in life, and regret for all the things they wish they hadn't said, all the things they should have said and didn't, all the things they wish they hadn't done, all the things they should've done and didn't. They feel great resentment for being pulled out of the world they knew. They are overwhelmed by the strong and unfamiliar sensations on their skin and the strange sounds. In addition, they can now perceive new senses that they  didn't know existed. Their eyes slowly become covered with a film that first dulls and then eventually takes away their vision, but they can still sense sunlight through their unseeing eyes.  The flowers are not conscious in any way. They are simply doing what they were programmed to do by nature. ",
